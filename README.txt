As stated in the description, this is just the mandatory part. I'll try the bonus part later. Hopefully.

So anyway, included in this repo is a simple test main.c file that tests all the mandatory specifiers with a very simple
test. If you really want to check if your printf is bulletproof, I suggest going to the other more sophisticated testers
by more thorough creators like Tripouille or paulo-santana.
